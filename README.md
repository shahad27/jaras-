# Repository Auto-Adder

**Repository Auto-Adder** is a GitHub automation tool that automatically adds new repositories to your GitHub account as soon as they're created. It saves time by removing the need to manually set up each repository, reducing effort and mistakes.

## Key Features
- **Automated Repository Creation**: Instantly adds new repositories to your GitHub account without any manual steps.
- **Customizable Configuration**: Configure the setup options (e.g., repository name, description, visibility) according to your workflow.
- **Easy Integration**: Integrates smoothly with any development workflow and manages all future repo creations.
- **Supports Multiple Repositories**: Automatically handles multiple repositories, whether you create them locally or through other CI/CD pipelines.
- **Continuous Integration Friendly**: Integrates with GitHub Actions, enabling further automation in your CI/CD pipelines.

## Why Use Repository Auto-Adder?
Manually creating and setting up repositories can be time-consuming and prone to mistakes, especially when working on multiple projects. **Repository Auto-Adder** automates this, ensuring your repos are ready to use right away.

## How It Works
1. **Install and Configure**: Set up the automation script on your local machine or CI/CD pipeline.
2. **Create Repositories**: As soon as you create a new repository, the tool will automatically add it to your GitHub account.
3. **Automation Rules**: You can define rules (e.g., repository name patterns, access permissions) to control how new repositories are added and configured.
